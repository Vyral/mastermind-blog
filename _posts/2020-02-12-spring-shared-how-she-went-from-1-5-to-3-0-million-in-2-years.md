Mastermind Club friends,

Our member, Spring Bengtzen, spoke for an hour at our last meeting about how she doubled her business from $1.5 to $3.0 million GCI with unique recruiting strategies&nbsp;

Her team was about 4-5 agents a few years ago. They kept leaving "every 2 years or so". She didn’t have a bench to replace her agents that left, so every time she had to start her recruiting process from scratch. This obviously took a toll on her and held her business back. I think many of you can relate to her story.

Here's what's really cool about Spring...

She shared the recruiting marketing system she put in place at our last mastermind meeting.&nbsp;**Now, she’s on pace to close $100 million with her top agent earning more than $250,000.**

Yes, that is a&nbsp;*confirmed*&nbsp;number. I check MLS and bookkeeping records (assuming the client isn't cooking their books) to make sure this is correct. I know people throw these around a lot and are not legit. You won't get that from me.

**She also hasn’t had an agent leave in over a year\!**

Spring broke her recruiting marketing down into 3 core pillars, which she gave us permission to share with you.

1. **Training website**. She has an agent training-focused website. You can see Spring's at&nbsp;[https://www.utahrealestatecareers.com/about](https://www.utahrealestatecareers.com/about)
2. **Facebook ads.**&nbsp;She runs Facebook advertisements to drive applicants. Spring uses causal agent testimonials, video courses, and personal growth videos as her ad content.&nbsp;
3. **Local events.**&nbsp;Spring drives all this attention to in-person events. She holds about one event a month to keep a pipeline alive she can recruit from. Her last event had 100+ people\!

I would love to introduce you to Spring, or any member or guest so you can build a lasting business relationship with them. That’s my job.

That's what we're all about. It's what makes us different than a conference or seminar.&nbsp;

We have four meetings scheduled this year. No more than 25 people a meeting.

You’re welcome to join us if you earn*&nbsp;at least*&nbsp;$425,000 GCI or sell 75 homes a year; however many here sell much more than that. You'll send us the last 12 months of your MLS production to verify your attendance.

Our meeting dates for this year are:

* March 26-27
* May 14-15
* September 24-25
* October 22-23

Call me at (619) 500-6563 or email me at&nbsp;[peter@mastermindclub.us](mailto:peter@mastermindclub.us)&nbsp;if you'd like to join us. We allow 25 agents per meeting, with no more than 1 person in a market.

A guest ticket is $700 which breaks us even together on the meeting. I share a P/L at the meeting so everyone who comes can see where the money went.

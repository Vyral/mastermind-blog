Real estate clients and friends,

Are you planning your 2020 travel dates like me right now?

Mastermind Club meetings this year are:

* March 26-27
* May 14-15
* September 24-25
* October 22-23

They are all in downtown San Diego at University Club.

Talk to me about a guest invite if you're seeking a smaller venue where you can&nbsp;*build relationships*&nbsp;with really smart top producers.

A ticket is $700. You can come to any one of our meetings as a guest if someone in your market isn't already booked for it.

We don't allow any competitors in the room because, obviously, sensitive insight is being shared with the group by all.

The 2-day meeting costs us $17,500 to do right. We divide it equally between the 25 people who join us. (I give you a P/L at the meeting)

We pay for all the meals and entertainment so we stay together.

We bring together&nbsp;*business people who happen to sell real estate*&nbsp;to share what's working now and to help each other with our goals.

**I would love for you to make a meeting**. Talk to me about it.

[Here's the agenda](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2433991/MastermindClub/The%20Perfect%20Mastermind%20Agenda.pdf?utm_campaign=Real%20Estate%20Agent&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PW6zb4fyqkP6FLbuLR21unZ559e0ZV-DDXype9U5jQ9M1HI4Bp8mY6QrmMHivMCBytItG){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;(PDF). No, it's not perfect. We tweak it a bit each time to get it just right. The point is we have a really good plan to run these well for you.

We allow 1 agent per available market with a 75 unit / $425k GCI production minimum. We limit the size to 25 people.

This is not a conference, seminar, or workshop. This is a pure&nbsp;*mastermind*. We're here to learn deeply from each other.

Everyone at the meeting is a speaker - you'll have 10 minutes to share one thing that's made you a lot of money with your peers.

There are plenty of topic tables, group discussions, thinking tools, presentations, and networking breaks too.

**If you're interested, email me&nbsp;[frank@getvyral.com](mailto:frank@getvyral.com)&nbsp;or submit your interest on the website.**

I'll have you speak with Peter, our Membership Chair, for an interview.

We'll explain what we're all about and if attending makes sense.

**You'll also get a list of who will be in the room with you.**

You'll be very impressed the talent we attract. In our first meeting last year, the combined home sales were over&nbsp;*3,000 homes a year.*

I'm also at every meeting (of course) leading it as your facilitator and host. I would love to get some one-on-one time with you, too. :)

Can you make a meeting this year?

Let me know\!

\- Frank

P.S. I have a great tip I'm recording tomorrow on "***How do I generate seller leads with cold email?***"

Expect it shortly. :)

I've been posting more Q&A videos. I'm wrapping up December's client theme on&nbsp;*building*&nbsp;your database of legitimate seller opportunities.

I answered these questions last month:

1. What’s the \#1 best Facebook ad for seller lead generation?
2. How do I hire a telemarketer to generate seller leads for me legally?
3. What’s the best direct mail letter for seller lead generation?
4. How do I get a mailing or phone list of homeowners likely to sell?

[You can get all the answers here](https://www.getvyral.com/blog/topic/weekly-training?utm_campaign=Real%20Estate%20Agent&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9PW6zb4fyqkP6FLbuLR21unZ559e0ZV-DDXype9U5jQ9M1HI4Bp8mY6QrmMHivMCBytItG){: target="_blank"}.

That's how you get seller leads into your database with marketing so you can nurture them with helpful, educational videos.

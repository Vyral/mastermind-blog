        <title>Spring shared how she went from $1.5 to $3.0 million in 2 years</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Mastermind Club friends,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our member, Spring Bengtzen, spoke for an hour at our last meeting about how she doubled her business from $1.5 to $3.0 million GCI with unique recruiting strategies &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her team was about 4-5 agents a few years ago. They kept leaving “every 2 years or so”. She didn’t have a bench to replace her agents that left, so every time she had to start her recruiting process from scratch. This obviously took a toll on her and held her business back. I think many of you can relate to her story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/spring1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;639&quot; height=&quot;427&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what’s really cool about Spring…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She shared the recruiting marketing system she put in place at our last mastermind meeting. &lt;strong&gt;Now, she’s on pace to close $100 million with her top agent earning more than $250,000.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is a &lt;em&gt;confirmed&lt;/em&gt; number. I check MLS and bookkeeping records (assuming the client isn’t cooking their books) to make sure this is correct. I know people throw these around a lot and are not legit. You won’t get that from me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She also hasn’t had an agent leave in over a year!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring broke her recruiting marketing down into 3 core pillars, which she gave us permission to share with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training website&lt;/strong&gt;. She has an agent training-focused website. You can see Spring’s at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.utahrealestatecareers.com/about&quot;&gt;https://www.utahrealestatecareers.com/about&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook ads.&lt;/strong&gt; She runs Facebook advertisements to drive applicants. Spring uses causal agent testimonials, video courses, and personal growth videos as her ad content. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Local events.&lt;/strong&gt; Spring drives all this attention to in-person events. She holds about one event a month to keep a pipeline alive she can recruit from. Her last event had 100+ people!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/spring2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to introduce you to Spring, or any member or guest so you can build a lasting business relationship with them. That’s my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what we’re all about. It’s what makes us different than a conference or seminar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have four meetings scheduled this year. No more than 25 people a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re welcome to join us if you earn&lt;em&gt; at least&lt;/em&gt; $425,000 GCI or sell 75 homes a year; however many here sell much more than that. You’ll send us the last 12 months of your MLS production to verify your attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our meeting dates for this year are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;March 26-27&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;May 14-15&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;September 24-25&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;October 22-23&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call me at (619) 500-6563 or email me at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:peter@mastermindclub.us&quot;&gt;peter@mastermindclub.us&lt;/a&gt; if you’d like to join us. We allow 25 agents per meeting, with no more than 1 person in a market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guest ticket is $700 which breaks us even together on the meeting. I share a P/L at the meeting so everyone who comes can see where the money went.&lt;/p&gt;
